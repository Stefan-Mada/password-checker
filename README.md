# Password Strength Checker

This program implements a password strength checker, that will tell you
how long your password will take to crack, based on the types of characters
you use in your password.

## Running the Program

To run this program, execute it with Python. You can either run it directly
if supported, or run `python3 strengthchecker.py` to run it. The only
dependency is Python 3.

## Limitations

This tool is for educational purposes only, and does not fully represent how
easy it is to crack a password. If your password was stored insecurely by a company,
than this will likely be a very inaccurate representation of how insecure your password is.
This should only be used to inform yourself about how different special characters enhance security.

## Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use

Please check the script before running it to ensure that it has not been modified. This tool does
not store or send any data about your passwords, as it runs fully locally. However, a modified
copy could be used to send your passwords to a malicious user, so please ensure that the script
matches what is seen on the github page here. Additionally, given a password breach, you
should always change your password no matter how strong it was, as improper storage by the
company would be able to compromise your password regardless of how strong it is.
